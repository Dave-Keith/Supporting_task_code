## This function is used to project the population into the following year based on the results of a full model run.
## This can be used to project 2 years out (but with no catch) which is used in the decision table to look at scenarios 
# using various exploitation rates.  You can run as many projections as your heart desires.  This gets fed into the decision table.

# Update history
# April 2016 - Revised by DK 
# March 2017 - Found a mistake in the process equation, we had m instead of mR in the recruit mortality term, whooops!!!
# May 2017 - Set up an if statement in the Process equation for cases when we get an NA, for the moment it appears these NA's
#            occur for cases in which Catch > Biomass and we get a negative in the process equation.  I have reset these to 0's
#            and put a warning message in the output to check the results to make sure this only occurs rarely and that
#            this is actually the reason for the NA's!!

# Arguments
# 1:  model.out:  The model run results 
# 2:  C.p:        The projected catch from the start of the survey year (i.e. September for GBa, July for BBn) to the end of a calendar year
#                 If a second value is specified this is just a second catch scenario to look at.  Default = c(200,300).
