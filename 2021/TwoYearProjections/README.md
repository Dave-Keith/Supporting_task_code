**Projections analysis and figures were run using Two_year_projections.Rmd**
- Each area (29W, BoF, Offshore) has its own set of functions, hence the folders. 
- Any code **outside** of the area folders is simply reference material and was not used in the final analysis for the RAP. 

Dashboard was cancelled in February 2021. Latest version is Two_year_projections_dashboard.Rmd, but **IS NOT UP TO DATE.** 

For code used in BoF Technical Briefing (~November 2020), search the history of commits and roll repository back to that time. These are also archived separately on sky.
