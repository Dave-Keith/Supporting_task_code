# Supporting_task_code

This code is developed for work we do each year related to the assessment process but isn't a recurring theme in the assessments. This includes work on Frameworky like questions, little requests for odd assessment related questions, etc.

Things to note:

1:  This repo was devleoped in 2019, due to re-organization of file structure code developed in 2018 and previous will need some TLC as we have undoubtly broken links in many of these scripts.

2: The re-organization also moved the location of *data products* into this same folder (these data products are ignored by github for a number of reasons (privacy, storage constraints, etc).  They were generally (but not consistently) stored in the "Data" folder but the decision was made to keep this data folder clean to retain only direct assessment related products.

3: Non-data outputs (e.g. figures, tables, etc) are found in the ...Year/Supporting_tasks/... subfolders located outside of this repo, consistent with where we store our non-data outputs for our direct assessment related work.

4: Larger research projects (generally things funded either via external partners or via B-based) are not included in this repo
