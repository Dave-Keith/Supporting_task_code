## Second-level header

### Third-level header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

require(ggplot2)
ggplot() + geom_point(data=pressure, aes(temperature, pressure))
```


## Important chunk options

* echo=FALSE prevents the code from getting printed to the document  
* include=FALSE prevents any code or output from getting printed to the document, but the code is still run behind the scenes   
* eval=FALSE skips over the code chunk entirely  

#### echo=F (output appears, code is hidden)
```{r echo=FALSE}
print("hi")
```

#### include=F (nothing appears!)
```{r include=FALSE}
hi <- "hi with include=F"
print(hi)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
rm(hi) # remove earlier object
```

#### eval=F (still prints the code, but doesn't run it!)
```{r eval=FALSE}
hi <- "hi with eval=F"
```

```{r}
# hi should not exist!
print(exists("hi"))
```

## Tables!

You can make tables a few different ways using packages. Some packages/functions let you make a very simple table really easily, but with limited formatting options. Other packages/functions are a bit more complicated to use, but have endless options for formatting. Here are two examples...

_You can hide the messages/warnings using message=F and warning=F in the chunk header. This will hide the package info!_

### kable
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
require(kableExtra) #or kable?
kable(pressure)
```

### pander
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F, warning=F}
require(pander)
pander(pressure)
```

## Reproducible writing

You can stick values from from an analysis in a paragraph of writing using code, so that you don't have to copy/paste in the new values for a reproducible analysis. For example...

The minimum temperature in the dataset is `r min(pressure$temperature)` degrees. The maximum pressure level is `r max(pressure$pressure)`. 


## Those are the basics, but now for the DFO-spin...

* Templates and knitting to Word documents
* Figure and table captions
* Bibliographies and citations
